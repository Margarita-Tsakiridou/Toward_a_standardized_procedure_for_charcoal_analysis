The code and data stored in this repository reproduce the analysis carried 
out in the journal article [Toward a standardized procedure for charcoal analysis](doi:10.1017/qua.2020.56).

The paper systematically assesses laboratory variations for extracting
charcoal from sediments as proxy for wildfire occurrence on centennial to 
millennial scales. The results demonstrate, for the first time, that treatments
can have statistically significant impact on the quantity of charcoal obtained.
Based on the results of our experiment, we make recommendations on what 
treatments researchers should use.
